Adult dataset cluster analysis
This project paper gives an overview of a cluster analysis of the adult dataset which was done in Jupyter notebook. The adult dataset was generated during a census in United States. The dataset consists of both categorical and continuous data. The aim of the project is to predict if a person would make more than 50k annually or not.
During the analysis, we handled missing data and changed categorical features to numerical data. We also used correlation results to determine feature selection criteria. The clustering algorithms we used are: K-means and Hierarchical clustering. 
In the first section, we define the problem and describe the features of the dataset. In the second and third section, we give information on the exploratory data analysis done and the preprocessing steps. In the fourth section, we talk about the analysis of the data and its results.
REPLICATION. Inorder to replicate or run this project, one has to download the UCI adult dataset, specify the persons working directory in the script and it should run perfectly. The dataset can be downloaded at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
